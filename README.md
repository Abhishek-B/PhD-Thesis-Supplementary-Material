# Non-negative Polynomials, Sums of Squares & The Moment Problem

Contains a mathematical notebook which is used to calculate possible flat extensions for *Example 5.15* from my PhD thesis "Non-negative Polynomials, Sums of Squares & The Moment Problem".

The code was written and implemented by Abhishek Bhardwaj.
